Bismark report for: /group/flchedingrp/mitochi/githubs/footLoop/PBEH1/output/reads/seperated/PBEH1-1/PBEH1-1_9_SH.fastq.gz (version: v0.20.0)
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /group/flchedingrp/mitochi/githubs/footLoop/PBEH1/output/mapping/PBEH1-1/9_SH_T7_init_VR_14/.geneIndex/942d91072bdb04f3f1410b448a3c4e4a/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.8 --rdg 2,1 --rfg 2,1 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	4
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	4
Mapping efficiency:	100.0%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	0
Sequences did not map uniquely:	0
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	1

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	2	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	1	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
